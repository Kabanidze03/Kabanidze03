## This is my repsository where I post my projects on machine learning and Kalman filter development


## In this repository you can find
- some popular models from scratch
- solving problems related to machine learning
- different Kalman filter`s algorithms


## Libraries, that I use:
 - numpy, pandas, sklearn, nltk, catboost, XGboost and others...
 - torch, torchvision, pytorch
 - matplotlib, seaborn
 - os, pathlib


## I want to improve my knowledge in ml, so i posting my projects for all, who want to see development progress
